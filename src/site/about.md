<img src="/images/pdk-about-photo.jpg" class="about-photo img-responsive" />

I am a product designer and design technologist with a passion for user focused digital products that are highly functional and beautifully designed.

My current job is Senior Designer for [Booz | Allen | Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/) where I currently support the [USPS](https://www.usps.com/) as a Senior Product Designer.

Prior to that I was the digital director for the global humanitarian aid organization - [Catholic Relief Services](https://www.crs.org/) - where I built and led the team that managed front and back end development, online fundraising & branding, user experience, information architecture, and email marketing.

I have been a designer and maker of digital products for over 22 years but really I have been a designer and maker of things my whole life. I started crafting objects as a young teenager. First finely crafted leather goods and then later hand made pottery. I spent 19 years making and selling [functional stoneware pottery](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/49891508357515603/) to the [American Crafts](https://craftcouncil.org/) Marketplace.

I am also an avid home cook and sourdough bread baker.
