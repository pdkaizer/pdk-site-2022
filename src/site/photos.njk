featuredGalleryName: My Capital Walk
featuredGalleryIntro: For the past 5+ years, I have been commuting to Washington, DC a few days a week to do design work for various US federal government agencies. I take the commuter train from Baltimore early in the morning and then usually walk to whatever agency I am doing work for. For the past several years I have been working for USPS so my walk from Union Station takes me past the US Capital. I have been documenting this walk.

I love to take photos - who doesn't, well I guess there are some who don't. I take a lot of photos when I travel but also when I am commuting to work, cooking & just doing things around town.
